    <Narrator line="A crowd of workers gathers around the captain."/>
    <Hilda line="Today is the day, people. At 6 o'clock this morning, 2 hours ago, we entered the Himalaian mountain range."/>
    <Hilda line="I've already reduced our velocity to relatively safe levels, but I still need everyone to stay on high alert until we leave the region!"/>
    <Hilda line="This might be the rockiest trip of your lives, people, so no slacking off! Any questions?"/>
    <Narrator line="The workers aprehensively mumble among themselves."/>
    <Tom line="I do, ma'am!"/>
    <Hilda line="Shoot!"/>
    <Tom line="Is my father going to pilot for this chunk of the voyage too?"/>
    <Hilda line="Yes, from 12 to 18! Just like before, I'm taking the yoke during the off hours! Any other questions?"/>
    <Narrator line="The crowd remained silent."/>
    <Hilda line="No? Alright, then. To your posts, everyone! Make me proud!"/>
