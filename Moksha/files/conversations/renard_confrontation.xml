     <Paul line="So, you've figured me good, alright. Sweet, mate! Let's all give ya a round o' applause!"/>
     <Baxter line="Darren... so it really is you. What do you want here?!">
        <Darren_present tag="tag"/>

     <Paul line="Oy, calm down, sweet poppy! No need to rush the proceedings. I'll be honest, things haven't gone exactly according to plan, but getting to face ya posh drum here might be even better!"/>
     <Renard line="What are you talking about? Frahm what plan do you speak?">
        <Darren_present tag="tag"/>
    </Renard>
     <Paul line="WILL YA SHUT YA GOB, MATE? This here is just between me and me good ol' chump Baxter. Innit, Bax? Aren't we chumps?"/>
     <Baxter line="Darren, I... I swear to Jove, I don't have enough insults to describe you. Entering here uninvited, causing havoc inside my ship-">

    </Baxter>
     <Paul line="Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration? You were saying something about... not having enough insults to describe me, innit? Well, go on, then! Name a few!"/>
    <Narrator line="Baxter stares at the gun, tense. Willow, meanwhile, struggles to contain her screams.">
        <Darren_present tag="tag"/>
    </Narrator> 
    <Baxter line="You wouldn't dare to pull the trigger, Darren. Not here, in the middle of the airship, where you could get caught at any moment.">

    <Narrator line="Paul smiles again.">

    <Paul line="That's where you're wrong, Bax, you slag. You see, not everyone is as meek and as coward as you - some, in fact, are even willing to put down their lives for a good cause."/>
    <Paul line="After you booted me out o’ the project, I didn't know what to do with me life, you know? Walking through the streets o' Newington, all bleak on the inside. Until I heard 'bout your new voyage."/>
    <Paul line="This, this right here - it is all I could dream about. Over, and over, and over again. And now, look at us. Look at me! And look at this gun."/>
    <Narrator line="Baxter tenses up. He knows what's going to happen next.">
        <Darren_present tag="tag"/>
    </Narrator> 
    <Baxter line="It doesn't have to end like this, Darren. I, I can still change the patents, rework your models. You don't have to shoot me like that. Not... not in front of my darling.">

    <Willow line="B-Bax!">
        <Darren_present tag="tag"/>
    </Willow>
    <Paul line="Oh, getting sentimental now, is it? Shoulda thought o' that before you stabbed me in the cadbury. Alright, I'm letting the missus look away. Do it now, girl, or do it never."/>
    <Willow line="No, please, don't do it!">
