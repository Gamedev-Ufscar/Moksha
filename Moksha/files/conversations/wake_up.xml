    <Narrator line="With a groggy sigh, you slowly wake up from your prolonged sleep. Meanwhile, Jenna is already up and running, doing jumping jacks and stretching exercises."/>
    <Elliot line="What... What's the time, boss?"/>
    <Jenna line="7 AM! Baxter's gonna give his presentation one hour from now, so you better get up already!"/>
    <Elliot line="I... Argh, alright. Just give me one second."/>
    <Elliot line="(Oof, did I drink last night? I don't think so... Maybe it's the altitude?)"/>
    <Jenna line="Hey, buddy, have you looked outside yet? The mountains look great!"/>
    <Elliot line="The... The mountains? Wait, we're already by the Himalayas?!"/>
    <Jenna line="Yep! I did say this airship is a marvel, didn't I? Well, anyway, you have one hour to get prepared. Don't forget to pass by the Viewing Lobby at 8!">
