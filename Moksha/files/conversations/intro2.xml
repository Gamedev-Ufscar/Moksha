    <Narrator line="You, George, Jenna and other guests board the airship, one by one. Some faces, you recognize; others, not so much."/>
    <Narrator line="The first two to board are Baxter and Willow Blakewell. The former, one of the owners of the company banking this project. The latter, his wife, an accomplished writer and a noblewoman from a lesser austrian family."/>
    <Narrator line="Albert Santos Wright is the next to board. He's the other half of the Blakewell and Wright Aviation Company, and a very skilled pilot, as it would seem."/>
    <Narrator line="Magnus Flettner, the mind behind the project, boards after him. He's german by birth, and apparently joined the company midway through its development."/>
    <Narrator line="After that, the reporter Claude Renard and his assistant Paul enter the airship. Jenna and Renard don't see eye to eye, according to her. You wonder why that is.">

    <Narrator line="You may mention objects, rumors and concepts to other characters by typing 'mention <someone> <something>'. Your list of information may be checked at any time by pressing TAB."/>
    <Narrator line="Some more guests are next - one seems to be another noblewoman from Austria, while the other is a female indian monk of some sort. Finally, it's your turn to board."/>
    <Narrator line="You, Jenna and George walk the steps to the entrance lounge, taking in the architecture and the design of the Medusa. If it looked grand from the outside, it looks even grander from the inside."/>
    <Narrator line="The only ones to board after you are Hilda Bernhard and her crew of workers, responsible for operating the engines. Most of them seem 30 or older, except notably a boy of 17.">

    <Narrator line="As soon as everyone is verified and present, the airship lifts off from the ground. The sound of gears and levers turning vibrates throughout the chamber, and soon the ground grows distant."/>
    <Narrator line="The skies engulf the Medusa in blue and grey as the guests disperse to find their rooms. Crew rush to their stations, and an overwhelming sense of awe overcomes your body. The voyage has officially begun."/>
    <Narrator line="There's no going back now."/>
    <Narrator line="-------------------------"/>
    <Narrator line="The first day goes exceptionally fast."/>
    <Narrator line="Most of your morning is spent finding your quarters and setting up your equipment. You and Jenna share a room near the north corridor of the airship, with George's room to the left and the monk's room to the right."/>
    <Narrator line="During the afternoon, you and Jenna rush around collecting statements and interviews from the two owners of the company, Baxter and Santos, taking photos and writing about the trip."/>
    <Narrator line="As evening turns to night, you two finally get to rest and visit George by the bar, where he apparently has spent almost the entirety of his day. "/>
    <Narrator line="You also do some light exploration around the airship, getting to know the main spots and obtaining a map layout from the captain. Jenna, meanwhile, begins to compile the interviews in her room."/>
    <Narrator line="At around 10 PM, you decide to call it a day and go to sleep. The sound of distant chatter and revolving gears lulls your mind, and soon, you go adrift. The stars outside your window are the last light you see before drowsing off."/>
