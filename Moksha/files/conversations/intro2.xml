    <Narrator line="You, George, Jenna and other guests board the airship, one by one. Some faces, you recognize; others, not so much."/>
    <Narrator line="The first two to board are Baxter and Willow Blakewell. The former, one of the owners of the company banking this project. The latter, his wife, an accomplished writer and a noblewoman from a lesser austrian family."/>
    <Narrator line="Albert Santos Wright is the next to board. He's the other half of the Blakewell and Wright Aviation Company, and a very skilled pilot, as it would seem."/>
    <Narrator line="Magnus Flettner, the mind behind the project, boards after him. He's german by birth, and apparently joined the company midway through its development."/>
    <Narrator line="After that, the reporter Claude Renard and his assistant Paul enter the airship. Jenna and Renard don't see eye to eye, according to her. You wonder why that is.">
