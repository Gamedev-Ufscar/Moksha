    <Narrator line="As the time to switch pilots approaches, Hilda comes to see Santos almost light-heartedly controlling the airship."/>
    <Santos line="Hilda, mate. Wasn’t expecting you so early."/>
    <Narrator line="Hilda grunts in response, looking a little wary of his handle on the yoke."/>
    <Hilda line="I wanted to make sure our lady wasn’t being mistreated."/>
    <Santos line="Oh, doll, you wound me so!"/>
    <Narrator line="He puts one of his hands over his chest, feigning being hurt."/>
    <Santos line="Wouldn’t let a fly get too close to her. And besides, you know full well I have a lot riding on ‘er too."/>
    <Hilda line="And you wouldn't want Tom getting away so easily."/>
    <Santos line="Oi, you brought him up, not me."/>
    <Hilda line="As if you wouldn’t take the chance."/>
    <Santos line="Just am curious!"/>
    <Narrator line="He gives a hearty laugh that Hilda doesn’t reciprocate."/>
    <Santos line="Speaking of, is he any better?"/>
    <Narrator line="She gives him a pointed look that he ignores."/>
    <Hilda line="He’s doing just fine. But I don’t have any news you’d like to hear."/>
    <Hilda line="Been following his instructions to a T. Seems to get along with the crew."/>
    <Narrator line="She pauses."/>
    <Hilda line="Maybe needs to have a little back bone, but what can I say?"/>
    <Santos line="He just needs to bite the bullet, ay? Start being a leader like his pa!"/>
    <Narrator line="He smiles at Hilda’s look."/>
    <Santos line="Had lunch yet, doll?"/>
    <Hilda line="Yes. If you are hungry, we can switch early."/>
    <Santos line="Ain’t denying such a nice proposition!"/>
    <Narrator line="He hands the controls over to Hilda and waves as he leaves the room."/>
